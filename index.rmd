# Introduction

The Oak Ridges Moraine Groundwater Program (ORMGP) hosts an [R-Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) server from which users are provided an interactive interface to timeseries analysis of data queried directly from our central database.

# Goal

In a series of pages, this will guide users on the many means of analysis included with sHydrology.

# Code

Here's some random `R` code in a block.

```
library(dplyr)
starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Droid")
```
